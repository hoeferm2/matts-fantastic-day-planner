## Project requirements

This project required us to create a daily event scheduler with interactive elements. First was a date that updates in real time. At the top of the page the  current date is display and will update everyday of the week.

## Scheduler

The scheduler meets specifications it covers the hours of the work day 8:00 am to 5:00. There is an input area to type and a submit button that logs user inputs.

However at this stage the page does not currently log answers and does not display them. The colors of the hours do not change in regards to the past present or future.

## reflection

This project is currently half done and will need to be resubmitted to acheieve all the set forth objectives. 

## gratitude

Thanks to Gabe Sowa for helping me troubleshoot a multitude of issues.
